    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "The provided code sorts a list of years using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This function typically utilizes Timsort, an algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**. In the provided code, the list `years` contains 7 elements. Therefore, the time complexity for sorting these years is **O(n log n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "Timsort, being the underlying algorithm for `sorted()`, has a space complexity of **O(n)**, where *n* is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity arises due to the additional memory space required for storing temporary arrays during the sorting process. In the provided code, since there are 7 elements in the `years` list, the space complexity remains **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency\n",
    "Overall, the `sorted()` function efficiently sorts the list of years using Timsort. With only 7 elements in the list, the sorting process is quite efficient, making it suitable for small to moderate-sized datasets.\n"
